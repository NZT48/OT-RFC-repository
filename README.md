# OT RFC Repository


OriginTrail Requests For Comments (RFCs) present system development and improvement proposals describing the network operation, protocol specifications, related APIs and relevant ecosystem components. It is a public, open for contribution repository for the OriginTrail community.

The RFCs have formerly been part of the official documentation on the [OriginTrail documentation page](http://docs.origintrail.io) and have moved to this repository from OT-RFC-07 on October 12th 2020 to the RFCs folder in this repository.


## Contribute

Contributors are encouraged to discuss in RFC specific issues (usually opened by the RFC author - see under issues).

Detailed contribution guidelines are TBA

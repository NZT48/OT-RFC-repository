# OT RFC Repository


OriginTrail Requests For Comments (RFCs) present system development and improvement proposals describing the network operation, protocol specifications, related APIs and relevant ecosystem components. It is a public, open for contribution repository for the OriginTrail community.

The RFCs have formerly been part of the official documentation on the [OriginTrail documentation page](http://docs.origintrail.io) and have moved to this repository from OT-RFC-07 on October 12th 2020 to the RFCs folder in this repository.


## The RFC lifecycle


There are three stages for an RFC, easily visible in [the RFC Repository Kanban](https://github.com/OriginTrail/OT-RFC-repository/projects/1).

- DRAFT stage: the RFC is associated DRAFT status in the period of writing and collaborating on the RFC. Once the discussions are completed the RFC moves to Accepted stage

- ACCEPTED stage: The accepted RFCs are to be implemented by the OriginTrail developers, serving as technical specification

- FINAL stage: Once RFCs have been implemented and merged into the codebase, they are considered FINAL

### The RFC rules & best practices

- RFCs move to the “Accepted” stage by the core developers, after discussions with relevant Trace Alliance working group task forces and the community
- A **“last call”** can be issued for an RFC which is close to moving out of the draft stage to notify the community to provide the final feedback (about a week before acceptance) 
- Moving the RFC to “Final” stage is performed by developers, responsible to indicate the specific client release that has implemented the RFC
- All RFC related discussions should be directed to the dedicated [RFC issues](https://github.com/OriginTrail/OT-RFC-repository/issues) page to promote a constructive, structured and long-term debate on the RFC, avoiding less structured channels such as chat rooms and social media.

## Contribute

Contributors are encouraged to discuss in RFC specific issues (usually opened by the RFC author - see under issues).

Detailed contribution guidelines are TBA.
